## Iliyan Yankov

I'm a very positive person with willingness to learn, looking to extend my developer skills and
knowledge.

My passion about technology, willingness to learn and desire to know how the things work made me change my career. In order to do that I used my abilities to learn quickly in a high pressure environment and graduate intense coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. Over the past year my ambition for success and my interpersonal skills helped me and the people I worked with to successfully complete many different projects.

After graduating from the University with a degree in cinema and after working for
several years in the hospitality sector as a concierge, I finally made the decision to make a big
change, follow my dream and do the thing I always wanted to do - work as a full stack software engineer.

## Skills

**Excellent communication**
For the past three years at The Knightsbridge Apartments, working as a concierge, I've often been the first point of contact for the people and I've been dealing with their requests. The work there gave me the opportunity to develop my written and verbal communication skills by daily responding to emails and answering phone calls.

**Strong Organization**
On my previous job I had to make sure that every resident request is completed by the end of the day. So I've split and organized the tasks, communicated with my collages and departments to make sure everything is done.

**Fast learner**
Last year In my spare time I have learned by myself Ruby, React, Node.js, JavaScript and I was able to build on my own a full stack [blog page](https://blog-anything.herokuapp.com/). I surprised all my friends and family when I decided to go and study in a foreign country without knowing the language - for one year I've learned Italian and I've taken all my First year exams.
