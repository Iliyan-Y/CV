## Iliyan Yankov

I'm very positive and honest person with strong desire to learn, looking to extend my Junior Developer skills and knowledge.

After graduating from the University of Bologna with a degree in Cinema and worked in a hospitality sector as a concierge for the past few years, I finally made the decision to switch to the thing I always wanted to be - a full stack software developer. So for the last year I learned to code and signed for another 16 week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, React, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Ant Design, Firebase, Heroku

## Skills

**Excellent communication**
For the past three years at The Knightsbridge Apartments as a concierge I was often the first point of contact for every resident request. I was able to develop my written and verbal communication skills by responding to emails and answering the phone every day.

**Strong Organization**
On my previous job I had to make sure that every resident request is completed by the end of the day. So I split and organized the tasks, communicate with my collages and departments to make sure everything is done.

**Fast learner**
Last year at my free time I taught myself Ruby, React, Node.js, JavaScript and I was able to build on my own a full stack [blog page](https://blog-anything.herokuapp.com/). I surprised all my friend and family when I decided to go and study in a foreign country without knowing the language - for one year I learned italian and took all my exams for the first year.
