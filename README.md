## Iliyan Yankov

I'm a very positive person with willingness to learn, looking to extend my developer skills and
knowledge.

My passion about technology, willingness to learn and desire to know how the things work made me change my career. In order to do that I used my abilities to learn quickly in a high pressure environment and graduate intense coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. Over the past year my ambition for success and my interpersonal skills helped me and the people I worked with to successfully complete many different projects.

After graduating from the University with a degree in cinema and after working for
several years in the hospitality sector as a concierge, I finally made the decision to make a big
change, follow my dream and do the thing I always wanted to do - work as a full stack software engineer.

## Skills

**Excellent problem solving and organisational**
Due to my experience as a concierge I was the first point of contact for the people and my role was to receive the request/problem, organize it into understandable tasks, split it into smaller steps and then take action of completing the steps to solving it. Dealing with over 200 apartments on a daily basis, every request was different in nature, often to solve it a fair amount of research was required.

**Love challenges and I’m adapting easily in new situations**
Clear example is my decision to change my career and graduating Makers Academy, but also I’ve graduated university in a foreign country - Italy, without speaking the language in the beginning, I’ve managed to take all my credits the first year, and the following years after. During my university education I’ve also joined a student exchange program and I spent 6 months in the USA studying and working. I’m also a multilingual person - I speak 4 languages Italian Bulgarian English and Russian.
