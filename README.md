## Iliyan Yankov

I'm very positive and honest person with strong desire to learn, looking to extend my Junior Developer skills and knowledge.

After graduating from the University of Bologna with a degree in Cinema and worked in a hospitality sector as a concierge for the past few years, I finally made the decision to switch to the thing I always wanted to be - a full stack software developer. So for the last year I learned to code and signed for another 16 week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, React, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Ant Design, Firebase, Heroku
