## Iliyan Yankov

I'm a very positive person with willingness to learn, looking to extend my developer skills and knowledge.
My passion about technology, willingness to learn and desire to know how the things work made me change my career. In order to do that I used my abilities to learn quickly in a high pressure environment and graduate intense coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. Over the past year my ambition for success and my interpersonal skills helped me and the people I worked with to successfully complete many different projects.

## Skills

* **Excellent problem solving and organisational** As concierge I was the first point of contact for the people and my role was to receive the request/problem, organize it into understandable tasks, split it into smaller steps and then take action of completing the steps to solving it. Dealing with over 200 apartments on a daily basis, every request was different in nature, often to solve it a fair amount of research was required.

* **I'm great teamplayer and I love taking the lead** (where appropriate) I'm currently doing charity work as a software developer for a mental health app. I had the opportunity to convince the team that automated tests are very important and I’m having the lead for increasing test coverage and improving the legacy code quality while delivering new features. 

* **I love learning and constantly looking to improve my knowledge**. One of the reasons why I decided to change my career - working in a fast moving environment is what keeps me motivated.I’m not afraid to learn from my mistakes and ask questions when I get stuck - the constructive feedback is one of the best ways to learn. To progress as a software developer I’m trying to keep myself on the edge of my comfort zone. After graduating at Makers I’m constantly working on projects trying to find the balance between mastering what I already know and learning new technology.
